# OpenML 

OpenML is a library providing implementations of common neural network algorithms in both PyTorch and NumPy (Dumpy). It includes:
- Activation functions
- Layer definitions
- Attention mechanisms
- Loss functions
- Optimizers
- Utility functions

Each implementation has accompanying tests to ensure correctness.
